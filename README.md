# DocHub-Web-Application
A Full-Stack Web App with LLamaIndex and Django to query and summarize documents

### Objectives

This web application aims to manage the documents and extract the information efficiently by using Large Language Models (LLM). By uploading your resource/document, you are able to ask anything on the chatbox that combines uploaded data. In the meantime, LLM enables us to summarize each document to grab its main idea.

### Source

This web application is mainly developed by <b>Django</b> (Web Framework) and <b>LLamaIndex</b> (Data Framework for LLM Application) in Python.
